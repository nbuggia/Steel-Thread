# Tech Design: Bug or Feature Name

\[Keep this under \~40 lines. If it needs more, or any Complex trigger in `.hashbang/framework/development.md` applies, re-size the task and rewrite this from the Complex template.\]

## Summary

\[What changes and why, in three to five lines. For a bug: the symptom, the root cause and its evidence, and the reproducing test. Include the settled scope.\]

## Approach

\[The files and functions the change touches, and the existing pattern it follows, by file. If it sets a new convention, say so here and list it under Lasting Changes. If it takes two slices, name them in one line each.\]

## Test Points

| Test (named for the behavior it proves) | Kind (unit / integration / UI / manual) | Spec rules proved |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

## Risks

\[Only the failure modes from COMMON-FAILURE-MODES.md that apply, and how the change handles each. Remove this section if none apply.\]

## Lasting Changes

\[What this change adds to the lasting documents. The close applies these; anything not listed is lost then. Write "None." when it adds nothing.\]

| Change | Goes to |

|  | ARCHITECTURE.md / CONVENTIONS.md / CONTRACTS.md / COMMON-FAILURE-MODES.md / DECISIONS.md |
